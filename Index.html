                <p>Not many are aware that football was once a very popular sport in India; in fact, the Indian national
                    football team was very successful in the 1950s and 60s. The reasons why football was reduced to a
                    back seat position in the country, was due to lack of proper long-term planning and the emergence of
                    cricket —which the nation became highly successful and famous in. Football is now becoming popular
                    among the younger generation of Indians.<br> <br>
                    In this piece, we look at the 10 greatest football players India has ever produced. </p>
                <h1>6. CHUNI GOSWAMI</h1>
                <img src="chuni goswai.jpeg" alt="Image of chuni goswai">
                <h4>CHUNI GOSWAMI</h4>
                <p>Subimal “Chuni” Goswami was a striker who loves dropping deep to help build attacking moves with his
                    extraordinary reading and understanding of the game. He starred for India at the 1960 Olympics, 1962
                    Asian Games (where the country won the gold medal), and the 1964 AFC Asian Cup (where they won
                    Silver). Goswami was reported to have turned down the chance of joining the English side, Tottenham
                    Hotspurs, during his playing days. He scored 32 goals in 50 matches for India.
                    He later dumped football for cricket and also became a hugely successful cricketer.</p>
                <h1>5. GOSTHA PAL</h1>
                <p>He was one of the best defenders in Indian football history. A commanding presence in defence, Pal,
                    is called “Chiner Pracheer” (The Wall of China). He played for Mohun Bagan and captained the club
                    for 5 years. He has a statue named after him in Kolkata. Gostha Pal was also the first captain of
                    the Indian national team.</p>
                <h1>4. I. M. VIJAYAN</h1>
                <img src="I M Vijayan.jpeg" alt="Image of Inivalappil Mani Vijayan">
                <h4>Inivalappil Mani Vijayan</h4>
                <p>Inivalappil Mani Vijayan, alongside Bhaichung Bhutia, were the toast of Indian football in the late
                    90s and early 2000s as they both formed a successful striking partnership. He was selling soda at
                    the stadium before his football talent was spotted. He represented the likes of Mohun Bagan, FC
                    Kochin, East Bengal in his club career. Vijayan scored 40 goals in 79 appearances for India and
                    holds the record for the 3rd fastest goal in international football with a goal he scored in just 12
                    seconds against Bhutan. He captained the Indian national team and won the Indian Player of the Year
                    3 times. At a point in his career, he was the highest-paid footballer in India. He is regularly
                    referred to by Indians as “the Pele of Indian football.”</p>
                <h1>3. PK BANERJEE</h1>
                <img src="PK Banerjee.jpeg" alt="Image of PK BANERJEE">
                <h4>PK BANERJEE</h4>
                <p>Pradip Kumar Banerjee was a right-winger who starred in the 60s. He captained India at the 1960
                    Olympics in Rome and the 1962 Asian Games — where the nation won a gold medal. He was capped 84
                    times (45 official) and scored 65 goals (15 official).<br> 
                    FIFA named him Indian footballer of the 20th century and was also awarded the FIFA Centennial Order
                    of Merit (the highest honour awarded by FIFA). He became a manager after his playing career and
                    managed some of the top Indian football clubs like, East Bengal, Mohun Bagan, and the Indian
                    national team. He is the most successful manager in Indian football history.</p>
                <h1>2. BHAICHUNG BUTIA</h1>
                <img src="Bhaichung butia.jpeg" alt="Image of BHAICHUNG BUTIA">
                <h4>BHAICHUNG BUTIA</h4>
                <p>Nicknamed “Sikkimese Sniper” for his shooting ability, Butia was a household name in Indian football
                    in the 90s and early 2000s, alongside I. M. Vijayan. When he was just 18 years of age, he became the
                    youngest ever goalscorer for the Indian national team. He went on to score 40 goals in 84
                    appearances for his nation. Bhutia is the first-ever Indian footballer to sign a contract with a
                    European team when he joined England 2nd division side, FC Bury, in 1999, and the 2nd ever to play
                    in Europe after Mohammed Salim. He also played for some Malaysian clubs.<br> <br>
                    A stadium was named after him by the Indian Football Federation for his outstanding contribution to
                    Indian football.</p>
                <h1>1. SUNIL CHHETRI</h1>
                <img src="Sunil chhetri.jpg" alt="Image of SUNIL CHHETRI">
                <h4>SUNIL CHHETRI</h4>
                <p>Although still actively playing, Chhetri is the greatest Indian player ever. He is very popular among
                    Indian football fans and is the face of Indian football in modern times. He started his career at
                    Mohun Bagan —the most successful club in India—and at a point in time played in the top MLS club,
                    Kansas City Wizards and in Europe for Sporting Portugal B.<br> <br>
                    He is the current captain of Bengaluru and the Indian national team. He is the most capped player
                    (115 appearances) and all-time goalscorer (72 goals) in Indian football history.<br> <br>
                    Popularly known as “Captain Fantastic,” Chhetri is the 2nd highest goalscorer international football
                    history, behind Cristiano Ronaldo. The 36-year-old has won the AIFF player of the year a record six
                    times so far.</p>
